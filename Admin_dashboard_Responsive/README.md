## Dashboard  Project
This is a simple and static dashboard project designed using html, css and javaScript.
The dashboard is completely static. But the system itself follow the mobile first principle.
In it, there are two charts designed using apexcharts library:
	- A bar chart;
	- A mixed area chart

You can find use this epexchart library by conneting to its cdn at [cdnjs.cloudfire.com](cdnjs.cloudfire.com)
then go to its website at [https://apexcharts.com/](https://apexcharts.com/). There, you
can find any chart type you want for any of you purpose.

This is how the dashboard looks like in a wide view.
